When looking for tools already used for analyzing data there wasnâ€™t any algorithms found. Most similar projects devloped their own algorithms and gave an overview of how they worked. 
All sources essentially indicate that simple algorithms were used to filter out the static sources of WiFi probes. (static meaning devices nearby that arent moving, but emitting WiFi probe requests. Next, there was just a simple algorithm to match MAC addresses and figure out the difference in time when the MAC address is detected between the two different access points. 
Below are a few sources on similar projects:
