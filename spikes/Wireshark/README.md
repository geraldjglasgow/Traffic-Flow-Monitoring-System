Wireshark and tshark - 

TShark is a network protocol analyzer. It lets you capture packet data from a live network, or read packets from a previously saved capture file, either printing a decoded form of those packets to the standard output or writing the packets to a file. TShark's native capture file format is pcap format, which is also the format used by tcpdump and various other tools.

Wireshark lets you see whatâ€™s happening on your network at a microscopic level and is the de facto standard across many commercial and non-profit enterprises, government agencies, and educational institutions. 

Using either of these programs with the .pcap file output from kismet itâ€™s possible to use filters to obtain and safe the output needed. In this case the filter was wlan.fc.type_subtype==0x04 filter was used to only display the probe requests detected and these requests can be later analyzed. 

Here is the command to install tshark in linux:
 > sudo apt-get install tshark
