Aciclica and Librium are both large companies that provide the same service this project is being designed for,
but there is a huge cost associated with these companies devices and many more features that might not be fully 
necessary for what some clients need. WiFi signal, bluetooth signal, GSM cellular signal, camera's, noise detectors, 
and more will be put into each device for measuring traffic flow and density.

The devices from both these companies range from $2,000 to $3,000 for use over a month. In addition, smaller individual 
projects that focus on one or two of these methods are very common and well tested. Some of the most researched are 
WiFi and bluetooth. Larger projects that involve machine learning use microphones or cameras to capture noise and analyze
how many cars are passing.
