When the r-pi starts up a script will be run to automatically host an ad-hoc network.
If a known client doesn't try to connect within 2 minutes, then the r-pi will switch to 
monitor mode and begin logging traffic.
If a specific client connects to the network within the couple minutes, then the ad-hoc network 
will persist as long as the client is connected.
