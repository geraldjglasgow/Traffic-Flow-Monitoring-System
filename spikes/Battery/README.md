To power this project I used 20Ah, 2Ah, and 2.5Ah Li Ion batteries. Since we aren't responsible for the case or battery for the final version of this project some cheap LiPo's were used for testing purposes. Initally Gel cell battery's were 
considered, but ultimately not chosen because they are about the same price, are much larger with a lot of weight, and require special charging equipment.

These LiPo batteries that were chosen will last about from 4 to 40 hours before needed charge on the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3.
Testing on the Raspberry pi zero is still ongoing.
This supplies sufficient time for testing multiple times throughout a day or days when gathering data.
