Bluelog

Bluelog is a Linux Bluetooth scanner with optional daemon mode and web front-end, designed for site surveys and traffic monitoring. It's intended to be run for long periods of time in a static location to determine how many discoverable Bluetooth devices there are in the area.

A basic Bluelog scan can be done as follows
> $ bluelog -vtn

When release 2 is being worked on, bluelog will most likely be used to collect bluetooth information. The commands to run this software are simple and the data displayed in a .log file are easy to parse and read. In addition there is bluepropro software that will read data from the .log file, then analyze and display the findings.
