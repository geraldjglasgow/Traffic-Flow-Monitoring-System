This is a spike on kismet.

Since kismet uses a lot of resources and has way more configurations and detection methods than needed for this project, we decided to use the Scapy library with python. A python script was written to specifically just detect and log any probe requests from nearby devices. 

This is a simple library that makes it easy to write short programs for specific purposes relating to low level internet concepts. This program could easily be written in C as well since the scapy library has a version written for C.
