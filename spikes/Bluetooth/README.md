All bluetooth devices are classified under one of 4 power classes:

Class 4: -3dBm or .5mW and has a range up to .5 meters
Class 3: 0dBm or 1mW and has a range up to 1 meters
Class 2: 4dBm or 2.5mW and has a range up to 10 meters
Class 1: 20dBm or 100mW and has a range up to 100 meters

Bluetooth versions tell the data rate of the device
5.0 = 50Mbit/s
4.0 = 24Mbit/s
3.0 = 24Mbit/s
2.0 = 3Mbit/s

Most bluetooth devices are very cheap and accessible. For this project a Class 1, version 4.0 adapter
will be used to log bluetooth mac addresses.
