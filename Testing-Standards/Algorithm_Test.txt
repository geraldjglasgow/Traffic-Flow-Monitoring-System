An algorithm to analyze and omit irrelevant data to the project will be coded, when this is done,  it will need to pass a test before it can be pushed to the repo.
Some of the criteria for this test include: 
	- Making sure static MAC addresses (from nearby buildings or houses) are taken out of the data
	- Making sure only one record of each MAC address is kept, as phones tend to send multiple requests in a short period of time. 
	- Take into account that more that one phone or WiFi integrated device could be inside the moving car.

Other criteria will be added as the algorithm is designed and coded.

In addition, Unit testing will be implemented. Aftificial data will be created where the number of cars passing by, the speed, the number of cars detected are all known. The program will have to be run with this data and give output similar to what was expected.
